# Useful Things

A collection of useful scripts and assets that I use for Unity projects

## Installation

Using the Unity Package manager, you can click add git url and insert https://github.com/A-G-K/UsefulThings.git

OR

Add `"com.agk.usefulthings": "https://github.com/A-G-K/UsefulThings.git"` to your manifest.json

For specific versions, do something like `"com.agk.usefulthings": "https://github.com/A-G-K/UsefulThings.git#v0.1"` to your manifest.json
